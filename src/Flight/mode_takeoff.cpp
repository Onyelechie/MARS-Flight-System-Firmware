/*   Check for automatic takeoff conditions being met using the following sequence:
 *   1) Check for adequate GPS lock - if not return false
 *   2) Check the gravity compensated longitudinal acceleration against the threshold and start the timer if true
 *   3) Wait until the timer has reached the specified value (increments of 0.1 sec) and then check the GPS speed against the threshold
 *   4) If the GPS speed is above the threshold and the attitude is within limits then return true and reset the timer
 *   5) If the GPS speed and attitude within limits has not been achieved after 2.5 seconds, return false and reset the timer
 *   6) If the time lapsed since the last timecheck is greater than 0.2 seconds, return false and reset the timer
 *   NOTE : This function relies on the TECS 50Hz processing for its acceleration measure.
