# Code Style and Code Commenting

To maintain maintenance and code readability, we have implemented a standard that all repository contributors of Limitless Aeronautics should follow.

## Coding style

The majority of the code written is in either C/C++, or Assembly language. C++ code with follow the clang_format coding style to increase readability and prevent confusion among new contributors and new commits from established contributors.

For example

`Loglevel_t Logger::create_log_message(flight_data_t &flight_data)
{
    SharedMemory &sharedMemory = SharedMemory::getInstance();
    std::ofstream logFile("Logging_Results.txt");
    if (logFile.is_open())
    {
        logFile << "\nLOG EVENT:" << std::endl;
        logFile << "\t{" << std::endl;
        logFile << "\t\tID: " << flight_data.id << std::endl;
        logFile << "\t\tTIME: " << flight_data.timestamp << std::endl;
        logFile << "\t\tDATA: " << flight_data.data << std::endl;
        logFile << "\t\tMACHINE STATE: " << machine_state << std::endl;
        logFile << "\t}\n\n" << std::endl;

        logFile.close();
    }
    else
    {
        return status = LOG_ERROR;
    }

    sharedMemory.storeMessage(flight_data);
    return status = LOG_INFO;
}`

The code presented here is an example of clang format being used. You may already be familiar with the style as it is learned early on in developer's career.

## Commenting

When writing new functions, it is required that you use the boxing or Doxygen commenting sytle to document your code. With Doxygen being the most preferred as it gives use the ability to generate documentation instead of manually creating the docs after the code.

**Doxygen**

`/**
 * @brief Creates a log message based on flight data and stores it in a file.
 *
 * This function takes flight data as input and creates a log message containing
 * information such as ID, timestamp, data, and machine state. The log message
 * is stored in a file named "Logging_Results.txt". Additionally, the log message
 * is stored in shared memory using the SharedMemory class.
 *
 * @param[in] flight_data The flight data structure containing ID, timestamp, and data.
 * @return The status of the log creation and storage. Returns LOG_INFO on success,
 *         or LOG_ERROR if the log file couldn't be opened for writing.
 */
Loglevel_t Logger::create_log_message(flight_data_t &flight_data) {
    SharedMemory &sharedMemory = SharedMemory::getInstance();
    std::ofstream logFile("Logging_Results.txt");
    if (logFile.is_open()) {
        logFile << "\nLOG EVENT:" << std::endl;
        logFile << "\t{" << std::endl;
        logFile << "\t\tID: " << flight_data.id << std::endl;
        logFile << "\t\tTIME: " << flight_data.timestamp << std::endl;
        logFile << "\t\tDATA: " << flight_data.data << std::endl;
        logFile << "\t\tMACHINE STATE: " << machine_state << std::endl;
        logFile << "\t}\n\n" << std::endl;

        logFile.close();
    } else {
        return status = LOG_ERROR;
    }

    sharedMemory.storeMessage(flight_data);
    return status = LOG_INFO;
}
`

**Boxing style**

`//____________________________________________________________
/* Creates a log message based on flight data and stores it in a file.
===========================================================================
|    flight_data   The flight data structure containing event information
|    status        The status of the log creation and storage

*/
Loglevel_t Logger::create_log_message(flight_data_t& flight_data) {
    SharedMemory& sharedMemory = SharedMemory::getInstance();
    std::ofstream logFile("Logging_Results.txt");
    if (logFile.is_open()) {
        logFile << "\nLOG EVENT:" << std::endl;
        logFile << "\t{" << std::endl;
        logFile << "\t\tID: " << flight_data.id << std::endl;
        logFile << "\t\tTIME: " << flight_data.timestamp << std::endl;
        logFile << "\t\tDATA: " << flight_data.data << std::endl;
        logFile << "\t\tMACHINE STATE: " << machine_state << std::endl;
        logFile << "\t}\n\n" << std::endl;

        logFile.close();
    } else {
        return status = LOG_ERROR;
    }

    sharedMemory.storeMessage(flight_data);
    return status = LOG_INFO;
}

# Code interfacing

Our coding style involves declaring our necessary function prototypes and other tools within header files, then defining them within the translation unit(source file) to provide the needed APIs for future use.

For example, we would declare a function prototype named func_prototype within a class in a file name tool.h(pp) to later define within a translation unit:

**tool.h(pp)**

`
class toolbox
{
    toolbox(){}

public:
    /* Apply our commenting style here */
    void func_prototype(void);

private:


}`

We require functions pertaining to certain functionality within a subsystem to be declared within a class because of the modularity it comes with it. Everything we need will be within the scope of the class, so we can then easily reference the API to get what we need without conflicts.


## Visualization

Code visualization is a helpful way to describe what something does without having to do much speaking and more drawing

In the figure, the author shows a clear representation of memory segments without having to go into too much writing on it. Though it is not a strict requirement, it is greatly appreciated if you add a little visual context to your code so that we can understand more faster and without having to read through a bunch of functions.


## Code summary

Just like functions having a summary, and/or visualization, you also have the option to summarize the usage of the file with a quick explaination at the top using simple commenting.

For long paragraph comments, you should use the forward slash (/) and the asterisk (*) symbols to create a comment block.

**Comment Block**

/* This is a comment block contained onto one line */

/*
This is a comment block spanning a few lines
Code I put within these barriers are interpreted as comments.
*/


**Functions within a program**

Just like a summary, you can also list of the name of each function prototype, class, enum, ect. inside a summary to reduce the need to manually search for functions.

**Function summaries**

`example.h(pp)

/* Within this file contain the following functions:

void function_prototype1        Function that returns nothing
int function_getter             Function getter
void*(*Function)(int, int)      Function pointer with no return value
int*(Function)(void*, int)      Function pointer that returns a pointer to an integer

`

# Commend indentation

Shown above in the example were very evenly aligned comments. The indentation of comments is a unique detail to add to your code when collaborating with us. This helps to keep comments more organised and not all over the place.
